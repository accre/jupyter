Notebooks and Demos for Using JupyterHub with HDFS and Spark at Vanderbilt.

# Notebooks

- **00-create-py2-data-science-kernel.ipynb** Simple notebook demonstrating how 
to build your own custom Python 2 kernel. This example uses the **%%bash** cell
magic command and creates a Python virtual environment that many popular data
science packages are then installed into. Finally, a Jupyter kernel is built 
from this virtual environment, enabling you to select this kernel for future
notebooks you create in the Jupyter environment.


- **01-create-py3-data-science-kernel.ipynb** The same as above except with Python 3
rather than Python 2.
